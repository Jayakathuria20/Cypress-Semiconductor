# Introduction

This repository contains examples and demos for **PSoC 4 MCU ** family of devices, world's Most Flexible 32-bit ARM Cortex-M0 One-Chip Solution. Cypress provides a wealth of data at [www.cypress.com](http://www.cypress.com/) to help you select the right PSoC device and effectively integrate it into your design. Visit our [PSoC 4 MCU](http://www.cypress.com/products/32-bit-arm-cortex-m0-psoc-4) webpage to explore more about PSoC 4 MCU family of device.

Feel free to explore through the code example source files and Let us innovate together!

# Navigating the Repository

The examples provided on this GitHub page are grouped into different categories like Connectivity (BLE, USB, CAN, LIN), Digital Subsystem  (TCPWM, I2C, UART, SPI etc.), Analog Subsystem (ADC, CapSense) etc. for ease of understanding at block levels. You can use these block level examples to guide you through the development of a system-level design.
All the code examples in this repository comes with well documented design guidelines to help you understand the design and how to develop it. The code examples and their associated documentation are located in the Code Example folder in the repository.
The master branch will always point to the latest release. Older releases can be accessed by checking out/downloading their corresponding branch.

## Code Example List

### CapSense 
#### CE95285 - CapSense CSD with PSoC 4
This CapSense_CSD_P4_Design code example demonstrates operation of the CapSense CSD component with the PSoC Creator Software and PSoC 4 Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-042) or PSoC 4 S0 Kit (CY8CKIT-040) hardware. The component is configured with a linear slider. Visual feedback of a Slider touch can be observed via LEDs.
